# Trust Project - pay for your services with Crypto

Trust Project is a solidity smart contract that allows users to safely pay for services. It implements a two-step process to ensure that the creator does not scam the buyer. First, the buyer uploads the payment to the contract, and then the creator delivers the project. Once the buyer is satisfied with the work, they notify the contract, which then releases the payment to the creator.

# ✅ Features ✅

- Safe payment handling: The payment is handled by the smart contract and is not released until the buyer is satisfied with the work.
- Role-based access control: The contract has two roles, Creator and Customer, to ensure that only authorized parties can execute certain functions.
- Satisfaction check: The contract checks whether the Creator and the Customer are satisfied before releasing the payment.

# ⁉️ Why ⁉️

Crypto is all about scams, ponzi schemes and useless tokens. SAFE wants to change that with real applications that can help people, businesses and the world.
Let's make Crypto great again! We are going to start with something very simple - an app that allows users to safely pay for services.

# 🧾 Usage 🧾

> We are developing a website so that all users can use Trust Project easily. But, for now only programmers and blockchain developers can do it.

1. Create a new TrustedProject instance and add customer and creator wallets.
2. 🚀 Execute your service, write your code, draw your portrait! 🚀 
3. Ask the customer to add the payment to the contract(only native tokens are supported right now)
4. Add a link to your work. (If it is a service, then just add random data)
5. Customer will receive your work and will release the payment once he/she is satisfied.
6. You can receive your payment.

Users can interact with the contract by deploying it on the EVM compatable blockchains and calling its functions. The following functions are available:

- addPayment(): The Customer can add payment to the contract.
- uploadProject(): The Creator can upload the project link.
- getProjectLinks(): The Customer can get the project links.
- completeProject(): The Customer can notify the contract that they are satisfied with the project.
- receivePayment(): The Creator can receive payment from the contract.
